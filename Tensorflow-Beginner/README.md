# Tensorflow-Beginner
This repo consists of the very few models I built using Tensorflow that helped me learn the internal workings of TensorFlow, Google's Computation Tool. 

INDEX:

1. Simple multiplication and addition computation graph.
2. Gradient Descent 
3. Simple RNN LSTM Model
4. RNN LSTM model, Minibatched
